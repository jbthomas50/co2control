# co2control
co2 control system. 
This system controls a solenoid attached to a co2 tank. There is a sensor in the system that tells the arduino the concentration of co2 in the system, and then the solenoid can open and close to get thee correct concentration of co2. The concentration of co2 is set by the user using two potentiometers. 
There will also be fans within the system to create circulation. 
There is an LCD screen to display the co2 concentration setting and the current concentration.
